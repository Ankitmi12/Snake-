# Snake Game with Java Swing and OOP Concepts

## Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Java's Swing library and following object-oriented programming principles. The game allows the player to control a snake, navigate it across the screen, and eat food to grow. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the game boundaries.

## Features
- **Java Swing:** Utilizes the Swing framework for creating a graphical user interface.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** The game is designed using OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
